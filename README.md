# Deploy Rust API on Caprover!

This is a super basic example project that shows how to deploy a minimal hello-world rust API on Caprover.

The `captain-definition` file is the only bit that matters, the rest is just a default hello world app.

Make sure the name of your application in Cargo.toml matches the folder you choose to build it in (I used `app`)
